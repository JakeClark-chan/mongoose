on the left side of the gun there is a serial number. it is black and white it is stamped on the side of the gun. there are 2 numbers and it starts with a 13 and ends with a 8. if you could help me i would greatly appreciate it. i am trying to sell the gun. 


i have been trying to sell it and i can't sell it without going to the gun shop and having the serial number verified. it is a nice gun and i will sell it for the right price. i will have to go to the gun shop and do it myself. i am working on it. 


i have tried to sell the gun and i have been told they don't want to sell it. they don't want to get involved. i have tried to sell it and i have told them i can't sell it without the serial number verified. the reason i want the serial number verified is because i don't want some thug to get the gun and shoot me.


someone please tell me how to sell the gun. the gun was reported stolen on feb 21, 2012. i have the pictures of the original owner and the report number. i have also been told they don't care what is in the letter.

as with any gun they come with a owners manual. the manual is part of the registration process. when you registered your new gun with the batfe you had to fill out a form and sign it. you also had to give your new gun a serial number. the serial number is usually written on the bottom of the gun on a sticker. this sticker has a 1-5 number on it that indicates what kind of sear it has. you also had to sign the form in front of a notary. 84d34552a1
