as you can see, the process has tried to load the dynamic library at /private/tmp/libncurses.5.4.dylib, which could potentially be any location and therefore is not very useful for analysis. the library will not even be loaded. if the executable file is able to load the library with the help of a debugger or linker, however, the dynamic library can be very useful. that is, an executable file can load any of the dynamic libraries it needs by using the dlopen function. these functions are extremely useful for debugging problems with your programs, because they allow you to view the data that programs have with a more convenient interface than a debugger.


for example, if you have a program that crashes on startup with a warning message and needs to know the logfile in which this warning message appeared, you can easily ask the program to log this information.


in this case, the program could not find the library. this could happen if the library was never installed, if the program is running in the wrong place, or if the program has a memory address conflict with the library. this warning is an important part of troubleshooting for most applications.


another interesting phenomenon related to the execution of dynamic libraries happens when an application tries to load an unloaded shared library that is not present in the loading processs active memory. in this case, the loader will try to load the library into memory at a different location as it is trying to load the program. if the library is already loaded, it will not be unloaded to the correct location. if the library is not loaded, the loader will try again to load the library into memory at the correct location. if the loader is in debug mode, it will stop execution and generate a breakpoint whenever it is not able to load the shared library, making the problem easier to locate. 84d34552a1
