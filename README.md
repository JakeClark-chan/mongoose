the skill tree in warband is pretty shallow, but the combat is fun and the player can pick and choose their own path. the game is easy to pick up for a newbie, but there's still a sense of progression and depth if you want it.


so, looking at the development on the game, you can expect to see the game growing and improving overtime. this was pretty much the case withbannerlord, so it's no surprise that its successor will follow that trend. if you want more of a challenge, there's still the modding community to look into. the mod that's getting a lot of attention at the moment, mount & blade warband aimbot, is an excellent tool that will no doubt help to make this even better.


disclaimer: "mount & blade warband" warband aimbot beta is a tool and to be used at your own risk. please make sure that you have the game files installed on your pc. i have no responsibility for any damage to your computer. there is a possibility that your computer may be put into an endless loop if you do not have the game installed on your pc. this is an advanced tool, and i only recommend it to people who have experience with modding and installing files. all the credit for this tool goes to its creator, "scruffy."


the aimbot tool is a really handy tool and allows you to aim your crossbow and sword while in a battle. this is a really great way to make sure you hit your target while defending yourself or shooting at enemies who are obviously not your allies.


i recommend the mod to any player who likes a challenge in their fighting game. i have been using it on warband and it makes the game a lot more enjoyable. playing this mod in this case was better than playing on vanilla because of how much more information it gave the player. 84d34552a1
