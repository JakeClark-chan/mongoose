the force engine (which came to be out of a need to implement dark forces in modern opengl) has more about the engine itself and is intended for software rendering to augment rendering on modern graphics cards (such as pixel 2).


if the whole thing started off as a scientific study about spatial relationship, it could have easily turned into star wars' own doom. lucasarts knew they had a winner in the jedi engine, however they intentionally left it in the wild, however. 


"the star wars jedi knight campaign packs - dark forces" was created for dark forces ii which went into development during february 1993 and completed sometime in may of that year. the campaign packs contain the first level and one end credits cutscene from the original dark forces, but otherwise it's a straight port of the source code of dark forces i, and the duke's levels from dark forces ii. the campaign packs are no longer available, but the game can be downloaded at yuricamp.net. this was the first attempt to actually use the source-engine, and although the success is largely in question, it was the first port into a dark forces level. 


one development company, dark forces: star wars jedi knight campaign pack is actually being worked on for the dark forces source code engine. it is going to be the successor to dark forces: star wars jedi knight campaign packs and will include the first level and one end credits cutscene from the original dark forces, and the new levels and levels created by gearbox software. some people think this sequel will make the source game more popular, but it has not been announced what kind of license dark forces will receive or what it will be called. 84d34552a1
