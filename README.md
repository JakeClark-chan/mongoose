the game's latest years-on campaign, birthright, adds a new retry feature, keeps the game's ui up to date, and delivers a variety of neat new outfit options. birthright is perfect at providing an excellent foundation for a new generation of warriors to learn the basics of the series and how to play the game. perhaps the most exciting thing about birthright is that it proves that the future of the warriors games is looking brighter than ever. -- jason ocampo [ full review ]


catherine: full body is a game that we've wanted to see for a long time. when we first played the version of the game that was shown off at e3 2018, we were enthralled by the final fantasy xv-style combat and the contrast between this and marie's innocence. this version of catherine: full body is able to deliver that experience in a significantly better way than the one we saw at e3, and it's wonderful to see such a defining moment for a franchise finally be able to launch. -- jason ocampo [ full review ]


catherine: full body is, at its heart, a game about relationships. we have a protagonist, marie, who we follow through her life, from her childhood, to her youth, to her adulthood, to her marriage, and all the way to her death. the decisions we make in this game affect those relationships, and even the whole story of final fantasy xv is a narrative where we learn about what influences these relationships and why they grow or dissolve, and in both cases why so many of them end. if you decide that you don't want to kill the person you love, there's still a story there, but one that is not about the death of a beloved person but about the survival and growth of their relationship. -- jason ocampo [ full review ] 84d34552a1
