/**
 * The embodiment of the adaptive LL(*), ALL(*), parsing strategy.
 *
 * <p>
 * The basic complexity of the adaptive strategy makes it harder to understand.
 * We begin with ATN simulation to build paths in a DFA. Subsequent prediction
 * requests go through the DFA first. If they reach a state without an edge for
 * the current symbol, the algorithm fails over to the ATN simulation to
 * complete the DFA path for the current input (until it finds a conflict state
 * or uniquely predicting state).</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All of that is done without using the outer context because we want to create
 * a DFA that is not dependent upon the rule invocation stack when we do a
 * prediction. One DFA works in all contexts. We avoid using context not
 * necessarily because it's slower, although it can be, but because of the DFA
 * caching problem. The closure routine only considers the rule invocation stack
 * created during prediction beginning in the decision rule. For example, if
 * prediction occurs without invoking another rule's ATN, there are no context
 * stacks in the configurations. When lack of context leads to a conflict, we
 * don't know if it's an ambiguity or a weakness in the strong LL(*) parsing
 * strategy (versus full LL(*)).</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When SLL yields a configuration set with conflict, we rewind the input and
 * retry the ATN simulation, this time using full outer context without adding
 * to the DFA. Configuration context stacks will be the full invocation stacks
 * from the start rule. If we get a conflict using full context, then we can
 * definitively say we have a true ambiguity for that input sequence. If we
 * don't get a conflict, it implies that the decision is sensitive to the outer
 * context. (It is not context-sensitive in the sense of context-sensitive
 * grammars.)</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The next time we reach this DFA state with an SLL conflict, through DFA
 * simulation, we will again retry the ATN simulation using full context mode.
 * This is slow because we can't save the results and have to "interpret" the
 * ATN each time we get that input.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>CACHING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTIONS</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * We could cache results from full context to predicted alternative easily and
 * that saves a lot of time but doesn't work in presence of predicates. The set
 * of visible predicates from the ATN start state changes depending on the
 * context, because closure can fall off the end of a rule. I tried to cache
 * tuples (stack context, semantic context, predicted alt) but it was slower
 * than interpreting and much more complicated. Also required a huge amount of
 * memory. The goal is not to create the world's fastest parser anyway. I'd like
 * to keep this algorithm simple. By launching multiple threads, we can improve
 * the speed of parsing across a large number of files.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There is no strict ordering between the amount of input used by SLL vs LL,
 * which makes it really hard to build a cache for full context. Let's say that
 * we have input A B C that leads to an SLL conflict with full context X. That
 * implies that using X we might only use A B but we could also use A B C D to
 * resolve conflict. Input A B C D could predict alternative 1 in one position
 * in the input and A B C E could predict alternative 2 in another position in
 * input. The conflicting SLL configurations could still be non-unique in the
 * full context prediction, which would lead us to requiring more input than the
 * original A B C.	To make a	prediction cache work, we have to track	the exact
 * input	used during the previous prediction. That amounts to a cache that maps
 * X to a specific DFA for that context.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Something should be done for left-recursive expression predictions. They are
 * likely LL(1) + pred eval. Easier to do the whole SLL unless error and retry
 * with full LL thing Sam does.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>AVOIDING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTION</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * We avoid doing full context retry when the outer context is empty, we did not
 * dip into the outer context by falling off the end of the decision state rule,
 * or when we force SLL mode.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As an example of the not dip into outer context case, consider as super
 * constructor calls versus function calls. One grammar might look like
 * this:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ctorBody
 *   : '{' superCall? stat* '}'
 *   ;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Or, you might see something like</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * stat
 *   : superCall ';'
 *   | expression ';'
 *   | ...
 *   ;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In both cases I believe that no closure operations will dip into the outer
 * context. In the first case ctorBody in the worst case will stop at the '}'.
 * In the 2nd case it should stop at the ';'. Both cases should stay within the
 * entry rule and not dip into the outer context.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>PREDICATES</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Predicates are always evaluated if present in either SLL or LL both. SLL and
 * LL simulation deals with predicates differently. SLL collects predicates as
 * it performs closure operations like ANTLR v3 did. It delays predicate
 * evaluation until it reaches and accept state. This allows us to cache the SLL
 * ATN simulation whereas, if we had evaluated predicates on-the-fly during
 * closure, the DFA state configuration sets would be different and we couldn't
 * build up a suitable DFA.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When building a DFA accept state during ATN simulation, we evaluate any
 * predicates and return the sole semantically valid alternative. If there is
 * more than 1 alternative, we report an ambiguity. If there are 0 alternatives,
 * we throw an exception. Alternatives without predicates act like they have
 * true predicates. The simple way to think about it is to strip away all
 * alternatives with false predicates and choose the minimum alternative that
 * remains.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When we start in the DFA and reach an accept state that's predicated, we test
 * those and return the minimum semantically viable alternative. If no
 * alternatives are viable, we throw an exception.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * During full LL ATN simulation, closure always evaluates predicates and
 * on-the-fly. This is crucial to reducing the configuration set size during
 * closure. It hits a landmine when parsing with the Java grammar, for example,
 * without this on-the-fly evaluation.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>SHARING DFA</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All instances of the same parser share the same decision DFAs through a
 * static field. Each instance gets its own ATN simulator but they share the
 * same {@link //decisionToDFA} field. They also share a
 * {@link PredictionContextCache} object that makes sure that all
 * {@link PredictionContext} objects are shared among the DFA states. This makes
 * a big size difference.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>THREAD SAFETY</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link ParserATNSimulator} locks on the {@link //decisionToDFA} field when
 * it adds a new DFA object to that array. {@link //addDFAEdge}
 * locks on the DFA for the current decision when setting the
 * {@link DFAState//edges} field. {@link //addDFAState} locks on
 * the DFA for the current decision when looking up a DFA state to see if it
 * already exists. We must make sure that all requests to add DFA states that
 * are equivalent result in the same shared DFA object. This is because lots of
 * threads will be trying to update the DFA at once. The
 * {@link //addDFAState} method also locks inside the DFA lock
 * but this time on the shared context cache when it rebuilds the
 * configurations' {@link PredictionContext} objects using cached
 * subgraphs/nodes. No other locking occurs, even during DFA simulation. This is
 * safe as long as we can guarantee that all threads referencing
 * {@code s.edge[t]} get the same physical target {@link DFAState}, or
 * {@code null}. Once into the DFA, the DFA simulation does not reference the
 * {@link DFA//states} map. It follows the {@link DFAState//edges} field to new
 * targets. The DFA simulator will either find {@link DFAState//edges} to be
 * {@code null}, to be non-{@code null} and {@code dfa.edges[t]} null, or
 * {@code dfa.edges[t]} to be non-null. The
 * {@link //addDFAEdge} method could be racing to set the field
 * but in either case the DFA simulator works; if {@code null}, and requests ATN
 * simulation. It could also race trying to get {@code dfa.edges[t]}, but either
 * way it will work because it's not doing a test and set operation.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Starting with SLL then failing to combined SLL/LL (Two-Stage
 * Parsing)</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Sam pointed out that if SLL does not give a syntax error, then there is no
 * point in doing full LL, which is slower. We only have to try LL if we get a
 * syntax error. For maximum speed, Sam starts the parser set to pure SLL
 * mode with the {@link BailErrorStrategy}:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * parser.{@link Parser//getInterpreter() getInterpreter()}.{@link //setPredictionMode setPredictionMode}{@code (}{@link PredictionMode//SLL}{@code )};
 * parser.{@link Parser//setErrorHandler setErrorHandler}(new {@link BailErrorStrategy}());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If it does not get a syntax error, then we're done. If it does get a syntax
 * error, we need to retry with the combined SLL/LL strategy.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The reason this works is as follows. If there are no SLL conflicts, then the
 * grammar is SLL (at least for that input set). If there is an SLL conflict,
 * the full LL analysis must yield a set of viable alternatives which is a
 * subset of the alternatives reported by SLL. If the LL set is a singleton,
 * then the grammar is LL but not SLL. If the LL set is the same size as the SLL
 * set, the decision is SLL. If the LL set has size &gt; 1, then that decision
 * is truly ambiguous on the current input. If the LL set is smaller, then the
 * SLL conflict resolution might choose an alternative that the full LL would
 * rule out as a possibility based upon better context information. If that's
 * the case, then the SLL parse will definitely get an error because the full LL
 * analysis says it's not viable. If SLL conflict resolution chooses an
 * alternative within the LL set, them both SLL and LL would choose the same
 * alternative because they both choose the minimum of multiple conflicting
 * alternatives.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Let's say we have a set of SLL conflicting alternatives {@code {1, 2, 3}} and
 * a smaller LL set called <em>s</em>. If <em>s</em> is {@code {2, 3}}, then SLL
 * parsing will get an error because SLL will pursue alternative 1. If
 * <em>s</em> is {@code {1, 2}} or {@code {1, 3}} then both SLL and LL will
 * choose the same alternative because alternative one is the minimum of either
 * set. If <em>s</em> is {@code {2}} or {@code {3}} then SLL will get a syntax
 * error. If <em>s</em> is {@code {1}} then SLL will succeed.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Of course, if the input is invalid, then we will get an error for sure in
 * both SLL and LL parsing. Erroneous input will therefore require 2 passes over
 * the input.</p>

     * s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;

     * When the ATN simulation reaches the state before ';', it has a DFA
     * state that looks like: [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. Naturally
     * 12|1|[] and 12|2|[] conflict, but we cannot stop processing this node
     * because alternative to has another way to continue, via [6|2|[]].
     * The key is that we have a single state that has config's only associated

     * among the configurations are all non-epsilon transitions. That means
     * we don't consider any conflicts that include alternative 2. So, we
