 *  <li><b>Weak context sensitivity</b>: These are cases where full-context

 *  minimum alternative of the SLL conflict.</li>
 *  <li><b>Strong (forced) context sensitivity</b>: These are cases where the
 *  full-context prediction resolved an SLL conflict to a unique alternative,
 *  <em>and</em> the minimum alternative of the SLL conflict was found to not be
 *  a truly viable alternative. Two-stage parsing cannot be used for inputs where
 *  this situation occurs.</li>
